# Enigma Machine
Implementation of the Enigma code machine from WWII given as a homework project for UC Berkeley's CS 61B Data Structures course. Skeleton code written by
[Professor Hilfinger](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/hilfinger.html) which sets up input and output but all of the internal logic of the
machine including the regex was written by me.
